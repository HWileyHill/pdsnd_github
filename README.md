### Date created
The original form of the bikeshare project was finalized on February 12, 2022 (12/02/2022), but was worked on for 2-3 days before.  It was introduced to GitHub on the 20th of the same month (20/02/2022).

### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data Explorer

### Description
The Python program featured in this project scans through raw data, such as those returned by a series of SQL queries, and auto-analyzes them in ways that might interest the viewer.  The data in this case documents a bikeshare service that runs in certain major cities; for the sake of keeping the repository clean and quick to update, the raw data files are not included in this repository.

### Files used
bikeshare.py - Contains the Python program used to query the data.
chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv (not included) - Bikeshare data for Chicago, NYC, and Washington, respectively.  This is the data the program queries.
